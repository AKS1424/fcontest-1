       <p>The Atlantic Ocean Road or the Atlantic Road (Norwegian: Atlanterhavsvegen / Atlanterhavsveien) is an 8.3-kilometer (5.2 mi) long section of County Road 64 that runs through an archipelago in Hustadvika and Averøy municipalities in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It passes by Hustadvika, an unsheltered part of the Norwegian Sea, connecting the island of Averøy with the mainland and Romsdalshalvøya peninsula. It runs between the villages of Kårvåg in Averøy and Vevang in Hustadvika. It is built on several small islands and skerries, which are connected by several causeways, viaducts and eight bridges—the most prominent being Storseisundet Bridge..</p>

        <h2>Mermaid Cove</h2>
        <p>Although the club specialized in transforming young guests into “mermaids” it teaches swimming to persons of all ages, from toddlers to octogenarians. The theme of this multi walled mural was chosen by the business owners to illustrate being in an underwater Atlantis in the cooler and deeper Atlantic ocean. The mural includes mermaids, whales, a sting ray, jelly fish, a dolphin, sea turtles and numerous fish. A “pirate ship” play area is built into one corner of the pool area. The underwater theme is carried to the downstairs party area where the walls and ceiling give the appearance of being in a sunken ship</p>
